# Tracking Migration Using Python

With the growing technology, it is now possible to manufacture small GPS devices that work on the principle of solar power energy, 
so that we donâ€™t need to change batteries and use it back to track migration patterns of animals. 
GPS to track movements of animals using Python uses Python as a programming language to control and navigate GPS signals to track the migration of the animals. 
One of the prominent features of this project is its simplicity and high efficiency. 
We will be using a small data set that consists of migration data(the data set used is an open source .csv file available on the internet).
Here, we will be using data analysis and visualization techniques to load the data and visualize some simple flight trajectories, track flight speed,
and learn about daytime and much more using the python libraries pandas, matplotlib, numpy, cartopy, datetime.
