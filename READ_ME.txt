Tracking Migration Using Python

1. Introduction
With the growing technology, it is now possible to manufacture small GPS devices that work on the principle of solar power energy, 
so that we don’t need to change batteries and use it back to track migration patterns of animals. 
GPS to track movements of animals using Python uses Python as a programming language to control and navigate GPS signals to track the migration of the animals. 
One of the prominent features of this project is its simplicity and high efficiency. 
We will be using a small data set that consists of migration data(the data set used is an open source .csv file available on the internet).
Here, we will be using data analysis and visualization techniques to load the data and visualize some simple flight trajectories, 
track flight speed, and learn about daytime and much more using the python libraries pandas, matplotlib, numpy, cartopy, datetime.

2. Motivation: 
We all know GPS tracking is the latest type of technology that is being used for tracking locations.
With GPS tracking, scientists place a radio receiver on a person that picks up satellite signals.
The receiver uses this data to calculate where the person is and how and where it is moving.
The information gathered by the receiver is transmitted to another set of satellites, which then sends the data to the researchers. 
Scientists are working to make these tracking devices smaller to reach out to even animals and birds so that they can be tracked. 
Some GPS receivers can even be powered by solar power and are sufficiently small to connect to birds.
Scientists are continually working and researching to learn as much as possible about animals, their behaviours, and their habits. 
Scientists use many different techniques to gather information, including manual observation of animals out in the wild, 
observation of animals in captivity, laboratory research, and tracking and monitoring with radio tracking technology.
These information-gathering techniques help scientists understand more about animals, which helps humans know what animals need to be healthy and thrive in their environments. 
We want to make our project on something that will be useful in real life

2.1	 Objective 
•	Track Animals and Birds location automatically.
•	Migration pattern based on the movement level of the animals.
•	To give the researcher a way of gather information about animals.

3. Target specifications if any:
Our main object is to utilize the GPS tracking system available and build an animal tracking system using python programming and .csv file analysis using python. 
We want to make a system that will give 24×7 service by providing the information of location of the birds, migration pattern, and speed of movement. 
  Advantages of Tracking System using Python:~
•	This project ensures and provide information about animal’s behaviour and migration pattern.
•	Human Interaction is less.
•	Informs about the researcher and wildlife workers about the health of the animal.
•	Project is simple and easy.
  Limitations of Tracking System using Python:~
•	Once your tracker is lost, you can’t track back the animal.
